# E2E tests using docker

If you are trying to add/debug these e2e tests and don't understand what they are doing, I think the most comprehensible order to go through them is:

1. [generate-server-to-server-access](./generate-server-to-server-access)
2. [generate-remote-access-to-server](./generate-remote-access-to-server)
3. [generate-remote-access-to-lan](./generate-remote-access-to-lan)
4. [generate-server-hub-and-spoke-access](./generate-server-hub-and-spoke-access)
5. [generate-lan-hub-and-spoke-access](./generate-lan-hub-and-spoke-access)
6. [generate-lan-to-lan-access](./generate-lan-to-lan-access)
